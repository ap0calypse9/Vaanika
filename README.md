# (Work in Progress)

This is a basic **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** project I’m building to learn the underlying concepts of document intelligence.  
The idea is simple:  
- Parse and extract text from documents (e.g., PDFs).  
- Store embeddings in a vector database (ChromaDB).  
- Query documents intelligently using an LLM (Ollama).  

It’s still **a work in progress**, but the goal is to understand how RAG pipelines function in practice and to gradually expand it with features like text-to-speech, better search, and multi-document support.  

This project is primarily for **learning purposes** and will evolve as I experiment further.
